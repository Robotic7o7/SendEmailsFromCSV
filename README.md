# Node Email Sender parse via CSV

This is a sample project demonstrating the usage of [nodemailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer), [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) and [node-csv](https://github.com/adaltas/node-csv) packages to parse CSV files and use the data for sending emails.
This is suitable for sending event registration confirmation emails e.t.c. and to eliminate the possibility of HTML mails landing in the spam folder
